# eth_blockNumber

> Return the latest block number.

## Purpose and interpretation

The result is the height of the node's current execution-chain head, encoded as a hexadecimal quantity. Convert it to an integer before calculating distances or comparing it with a decimal height from another service. This call takes no positional arguments. A head height is useful for polling and lag checks, but it does not identify a unique block and does not prove finality. Read the corresponding block hash when tracking changes across reorganizations.

| Contract field | Frozen value |
|---|---|
| Canonical method | `eth_blockNumber` |
| Handler / public template | `POST /rpc/base` / `{HTTPSBase}/r/{key}/rpc/base` |
| Network | Base mainnet, chain ID `8453` |
| Scope | `base:rpc` |
| Availability | `unknown` |
| Minimum tier | `free` — enforced matrix policy, not measured capacity or runtime publication |

Canonical contract: [Base OpenRPC](https://triport.io/api-specs/json-rpc/base.openrpc.json) — the frozen machine-readable source this page is generated from.

## Params schema

Positional JSON-RPC parameters:

```json
[]
```

## Result schema

```json
{
  "name": "blockNumber",
  "schema": {
    "$ref": "#/components/schemas/Quantity"
  }
}
```

Schema status: `canonical_evm_schema`; complete: `true`.

## Parameter limits

| JSON path | Frozen limit | Source |
|---|---|---|
| — | `unknown` | No numeric parameter ceiling is frozen; enforce the declared schema shape and deny an unknown oversized/range profile. |

Historical block retrieval is not an archive-state guarantee. Selectors must be preserved; do not substitute `pending`, `safe`, or `finalized` with `latest`.

## Rate limits and tier

These are enforced product-policy values, not measured upstream capacity or an SLA. Enterprise is finite, never physical “unlimited” capacity.

| Tier | Limit / access | Category |
|---|---:|---|
| Free | 10 RPS sustained · up to 20 burst | base_read_rpc |
| Basic | 20 RPS sustained · up to 40 burst | base_read_rpc |
| Pro | 100 RPS sustained · up to 200 burst | base_read_rpc |
| Business | 250 RPS sustained · up to 500 burst | base_read_rpc |
| Enterprise | 250 RPS sustained · up to 500 burst | base_read_rpc |

See [Base limits](../limits.md) and [Burst capacity](../../rate-limits-and-tiers.md#burst-capacity). The included buffer refills at sustained RPS; there is no quota on the number of bursts.

## Errors

| Code | Meaning here | Client action |
|---|---|---|
| `-32602` | Parameters fail the declared schema or upstream parser. | Fix the positional parameters; parser acceptance is not execution success. |

Tier and budget rejections are not JSON-RPC errors: the gate decides them before the request reaches the RPC layer and answers with a plain HTTP envelope — `403` `tier_insufficient` (with an `X-Required-Tier` header) or `429` `rate_limited` (honor `Retry-After`). Both are enforced product policy, not measured capacity or an SLA.

Authentication/transport failures use the shared client error envelope. See [Base errors](../errors.md).
